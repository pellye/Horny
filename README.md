# HornyOnDemand
Literally just a joke "script" to open e621 with a optional confirmation screen.

Recommended use instructions:
1. Download horny.html or horny_speedy.html (or both, I won't judge)
2. Create a shortcut to the html file you downloaded
3. Right-click the shortcut and go to properties
4. Assign a key/combo to the shortcut (F5 is the og)

Now you have HornyOnDemand set up!


This was an idea from my friend Dan. He wrote a python script for this that barely worked so I just re-wrote it but in html with 1/10000th the file size (probably). 

(yeah he bullied me to credit him smh. hes still a cutie tho <3)
