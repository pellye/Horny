# HornyOnDemand
Literally just a meme script to open e621 with a optional (prob recommended) confirmation screen.

Recommended use instructions:
1. Download horny.html or horny_confirm.html (or both if you are really just that horny)
2. Create a shortcut to horny.html
3. Right-click the shortcut and go to properties
4. Assign a key/combo to the shortcut (Prob don't bind it to enter, but I won't stop you)

Now you have HornyOnDemand set up!


This was an idea from my friend Dan. He wrote a python script for this that barely worked so I just re-wrote it but in html with 1/10000th the file size (probably). 

(yeah he bullied me to credit him smh. hes still a cutie tho <3)
